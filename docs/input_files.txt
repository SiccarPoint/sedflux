\section sed_input_files Sedflux Input Files


The main input files are:
- \subpage sub_sec_init
- \subpage sub_sec_bathy
- \subpage sub_sec_sediment
- \subpage sub_sec_process


The above are all required files.  Files that are optionally included are:
- \subpage sub_sec_river
- \subpage sub_sec_sea_level
- \subpage sub_sec_subsidence

Many of these files, are of a similar format (sedflux key-file).
Although the format is simple, you may want to have a quick look here:
\subpage sub_sec_key_file
for a description.

/** \page sub_sec_key_file Sedflux Key-File

Many of the (ascii) input files for sedflux are of a common format.  I'll
often refer to them as sedflux key-files.  They are plain text files that
define a series of groups.  Each group then contains a series of key-value
pairs.  A group begins with its name surrounded by braces and ends at the
begining of the next group.

The key-value pairs then follow, one per line.  They consist of a parameter
name (or key), follows by a colon, and then the value.  As an example, a
valid group looks like,
\code
[ global ]
vertical resolution (m):   0.05
x resolution (m):          10000
y resolution (m):          100
\endcode
In this example, we've defined a group called \p global.  For this group,
we've set the values for three parameters.  There can be any number of groups
or key-value pairs per file.  In fact, the same group name can appear in the
same file more than once.  The data are not overwritten but a new instance
of the group created.  However, in some instances it may not make sense to have
multiple occurances of a group.

/** \page sub_sec_sediment Sediment File

The characteristics of each sediment type is defined by key-value pairs
in its own group.  A group begins with <tt>[ <group-name> ]</tt>, is 
followed by a series of key-values pairs, and ends at the start of the
next group (or EOF).  The key-value lines are of the
form:
\code
<name-of-key> : <value>
\endcode
Groups are listed one after another.  The order that they occur here is
important.  sedflux assumes that the order they appear here corresponds
to the same order as the river input files.


For a sediment file, the required parameters are:
- <tt>grain size</tt>                 Grain size (in microns) of the sediment type.
- <tt>grain density</tt>              Density (in kg/m^3) of the sediment grains.
- <tt>saturated density</tt>          Bulk density (in kg/m3) that the sediment saturated with water.
- <tt>minimum void ratio</tt>         Void ratio (-) of the sediment in its closest packed state.
- <tt>diffusion coefficient</tt>      Diffusion index between 0 (unable to be moved) and 1 (easily moved).
- <tt>removal rate</tt>               Removal rate (in 1/day)
- <tt>consolidation coefficient</tt>  How quickly the sediment consolidates.
- <tt>compaction coefficient</tt>     Rate that sediment is compacted under load.

\note The first grain type listed in the sediment file is assumed
      by sedflux to be bedload!  That is, it is not carried by the
      plume process but by the bedload dumping process.
