\section sed_modules Sedflux Modules

Many of the process modules in sedflux-2.0 can be run as standalone programs.

Standalone programs are:
- \subpage sub_sec_inflow

/** \page sub_sec_inflow Inflow

\section input_sec   Step 1: Setting up the input files

To run inflow, you will need three input files:
- a parameter file
- a flood file
- a bathymetry file
The inflow distribution provides sample input files in the share directory.
The sample files are inflow_param.kvf, inflow_flood.kvf, and inflow_bathy.csv.

\subsection parameter_file_sec Parameter file


\subsection flood_file_sec Flood file
The flood file specifies the flow conditions at the start of the turbidity
current (or hyperpycnal flow).  The format of the file is that of a
\subpage sub_sec_key_file .  Each group specifies the conditions for an
event.  For example:
\include inflow_flood.kvf

\subsection bathy_file_sec Bathymetry file

The bathymetry file is a comma delimited text file that describes the
bathymetry over which the turbidity current will be run.  The file contains
three columns: position, elevation, and width (all in meters).  inflow
interpolates between these points to match the grid spacing specified in
the parameter file.
