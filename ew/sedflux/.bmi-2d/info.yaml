summary: Sedflux2D is a basin-filling stratigraphic model. Sedflux2D simulates
  long-term marine sediment transport and accumulation into a 2D longitudinal
  basin over time scales of tens of thousands of years. It simulates the
  dynamics of strata formation of continental margins and includes turbidity
  currents and debris flows.
