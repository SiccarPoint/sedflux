summary:
  Sedflux3D is a basin filling stratigraphic model. Sedflux3d simulates
  long-term marine sediment transport and accumulation into a
  three-dimensional basin over time scales of tens of thousands of years. It
  simulates the dynamics of strata formation of continental margins based on
  distribution of river plumes and tectonics.
