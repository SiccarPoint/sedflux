add excess porewater pressure to Sed_cell.
   * new member of Sed_cell, double pressure
   * initialize pressure to zero in sed_create_cell
   * sed_clear_cell, sed_copy_cell updated
   * added sed_get_cell_pressure, sed_set_cell_pressure
   * sed_add_cell_to_cell - add pressure from b, to a
   * added sed_get_cell_consolidation
      * calculates the degree of consolidation of a cell
        given its age.  the excess porewater pressure can then
        be calculated as,
           u_e = s (1 - u )
        where u_e is excess porewater pressure, u is degree of
        consolidation, and s is the load on the cell.  This is
        from bardet.
   * added sed_get_cell_cv
   * alter sed_seperate_cell to keep the same pressures for
     each of the cells.
   * sed_load_cell, sed_dump_cell updated
   * sed_compact_cell - increase the pressure by the relative
     change in thickness.
add consolidation coefficient to Sed_type.
   * new member of Sed_type, double c_v
   * new functions sed_consolidation
   * updated sed_init_sediment
add excess porewater pressure to compaction
   * subtract excess porewater pressure from load in compact
   * allow for large excess porewater pressures if sediment
     is removed.
   * update Sed_cell::pressure for each cell
   * to determine the maximum compaction use the sediment weight
     without excess porewater pressure.  when actually compacting,
     use effective load (include porewater pressure).
add excess porewater pressure to failure
   * replaced gibson model with our new model.  Use the pressure
     in the cell at the base of the failure as the excess porewater
     pressure.
   * this is commented out right now but should be ready to go.
add excess porewater pressure to properties to print
   * added sed_get_pressure_check to sed_print.c
   * updated get_property_func, get_property_file_ext, sed_sediment.h
     and sed_print.h
   * new extension is ".press"
   * updated init_data_dump
add degree of consolidation to properties to print
   * added sed_get_pressure_check to sed_print.c
   * updated get_property_func, get_property_file_ext, sed_sediment.h
     and sed_print.h
   * new extension is ".press"
   * updated init_data_dump


Q. what should we do when we split a cell?
A. keep the same excess porewater pressures.

Q. what should we do when we resize a cell?
A. keep the same excess porewater pressures.

Q. what should we do when we compact a cell?
A. increase the excess porewater pressures.

Q. what should we do when we add one cell to another cell?
A. take the weighted average of the excess porewater pressures.

to do:
   * possibly remove some functions - sed_get_cell_cv, etc?
   * double check the Q and A's.
   * possibly remove some members of Sed_type - pi?
   * uncomment excess porewater pressure in failure (getsurface.c)

speed up failure.
   * remember the calculated facor of safety for each ellipse.
   * note columns that have been effected by failures
