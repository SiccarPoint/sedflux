/* An example of a distribution file for a random variable

Most values in a sedflux process file are given fixed values.
However, some are allowed to vary with time, to picked from
a random distribution.  For the case of a random distribution,
the user may specify a file that defines a distribution 
function.

The user defines the distibution by two columns of comma
delimited data.  The first column is the value of the 
random variable and the second CDF for the variable.  For 
the function to be defined correctly, a number of requirements
need to be satisfied,
- Both column must be monotonically increasing
- The CDF values must vary from 0 to 1 (and include both 0 and 1)
