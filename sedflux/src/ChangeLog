6 Oct 1999 :
   init.c : Within the epoch portion of the userl file the user can
      now specify a interval (in years) to dump results.
   main.c -> sedfluxDumpIsGo : New function added to check if it's
      time to dump output.  It's time if the user has given a kill
      signal or if the dump interval has passed.
   main.c -> runSedfluxDump : New function created to dump sedflux
      output.  The files are named MARGINNAMEn.EXT. n is the dump
      number, and EXT is the appropriate extension for the output
      file (grain, bulk etc.).

11 Jan 2000 :
   The time can now be greater that 1 year.
   main.c : The variable timeStep is now the time step in years.
