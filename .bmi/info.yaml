summary:
  Basin filling stratigraphic model.Sedflux2d simulates longterm marine
  sediment transport and accumulation into a 2D longitudinal basin over time
  scales of tens of thousands of years. It simulates the dynamics of strata
  formation of continental margins and includes turbidity currents and debris
  flows.
